                <p>I am Dragana Tripchevska, an potential graphic
                    designer with a strong academic background
                    and a passion for creative expression through
                    visual media.
                    I bring a keen eye for detail and a commitment
                    to delivering impactful visual solutions.
                    During my studies, I developed a deep
                    understanding of design principles
                    and techniques, which I have successfully applied
                    to various projects.
                    Professionalism, creativity and persistence
                    are my motivation for a successful career.</p>

                            for me. I didn’t want it to be offensive, but I still wanted it to be good
                            on the eye. I think I used a design that reflects my character.</p>

                            It consists of important data about the company
                            and characteristics that will atteact costomers
                            to collaborate. The company needs to be portrayed

                            with love and it doesn’t fulfill it, it deserves

                            up to expectations and do my best to get our client the best solution.
                            With a little imagination , we got closer to the customer’ s requirements.</p>

                            the day of love and wine as my inspiration. Human feelings are expressed
                            through a typographic poster.</p>

                            I created it in a more fuinteresting way as a different idea that challenged me.

                            When I got a topic that was about science, I immediately jumped
                            into the past. Whether dinosaurs existed, when, and what they were is a little
                            research that I put into this magazine.</p>

                            Based on their ideas and the freedom I god, I made this logo. Their request

                            This poster is inspired by that. Children are trapped

                        <small>Package design for a client</small>
                        <p>In collaboration with a paper packaging and water
                            can company, we have come up with a design
                            that will be interesting and appealing to buyers.
                            Their idea of using fresh colors gave
                            me the inspiration for this design.
                            I tried to come up with something simple
                            but enticing to everyone’s eye.</p>

                        <p>Educational platform website
                            Education in any field is a discipline that needs
                            to be performend at the maximum level. Of course,
                            effort and perseverance are required to succeed.
                            It’s very important how all of this is shown visually.
                            A well-designed website can greatly influence
                            young people’s choices.
                            Here’s an idea of what it would all look like on a
                            desktop and a phone screen.</p>

                        <p>Through creativity and a free choice of ideas, I created this poster. The notes,
                            the various lines, and sizes are mirrored my favorite song ,,Moonlight”.
                            Art and music are the best combination for inspiration.</p>

                        <p>This creation of mine is a fusion of different geometric shapes,
                            different sizes and lines that give an interesting contrast.
                            Abstract art through which we show our creativity. The game with various
                            pieces depicts a quite interesting contrasting picture.</p>

                        <p>I'm so excited to share the brand new logo design I just wrapped up for SONATA.
                            This isn't just a logo it's a symbol of their sound, their story, and the energy they bring
                            to
                            everything they do.
                            From the first sketch to the final touch, every detail was designed to reflect who they are
                            as
                            artists-bold, authentic, and ready to take over the stage.</p>
